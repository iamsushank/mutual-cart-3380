    <div>My Hours changed my business. Using My Hours allows me to not only count hours for each project to my clients but also allows me to learn about my business in terms of time slots for each task and project, which allows me to price projects more accurately. Through My Hours I also learn about the efficiency of my team in real-time. <br> <em>- Racheli B., Designer</em></div>
   
     <div>I have used other timer programs and found that My Hours gives me everything I need! I am able to track and report time for multiple clients and differentiate multiple projects per client. I also love how easy it is to edit previously entered time when I see that a mistake has been made. The export to Excel feature is extremely useful and allows me to quickly create invoices in my bookkeeping software. I'm all for easy, accurate, efficient functionality and My Hours definitely meets those criteria for me. <br> <em>- - Debra S., Executive Office</em></div>
    
    <div> I track my time easily and fast. I've been using My Hours for several years. It helps me track the time that I'm not charging my clients, get a better idea on how I spend my time, helps me to prioritise my time and alerts me to overspending on some projects. I like the ease of use, many options and parameters, easy and fast reporting, the reliability, the modern look and feel, and the online support (it's fast, the help desk really seems to care rather than just processing tickets).

    <div>The ease of use with My Hours is beyond great. Since I constantly need to track my hours for different tasks it's critical for my entrepreneur business model. It's easy to export & send to my clients with notes on what I was working on during each project, etc.  Overall, I absolutely love My Hours. I stumbled across it when I really needed this quality product. I recommend it for any freelancer, entrepreneur, or just anyone needing to track their own hours based on different clients and/or projects. Totally easy to use. Super useful & insightful when you look at the graph feature.
        <br> <em>- Sarah R., Marketing and Advertising</em></div>
   
     <div>My Hours time-tracking software provides everything we need as a small business both for our payroll time-tracking and for customer billing. We've been using it for several years now without any problems. The customer support is great and any questions are answered by return email within 24 hours.  The My Hours team are always listening to customer feedback and improving the product.  It's great value for money.Our employees are happy using My Hours for their hours and tasks on a variety of projects. I haven't had one complaint!  The administrator features are flexible and easy to use. Over all a very positive experience with this product and I can certainly recommend it as a cost-effective product for time-tracking.<br> <em>- Caroline G., Operations Manager</em></div>
    
    <div>I love how easy it is to use My Hours and how it gives me the ability to manage my time as a business owner. I can track the amount of time I spend in administrative functions, business development and client work, to make sure I am optimizing how I use my working time.
        The software is intuitive and allows me to configure for the tasks and projects for my clients. It is quite flexible. I have recommended it to all my entrepreneurial colleagues. My Hours helps me track how I use my working time. I use the data to optimize my business performance, to maximize my billable hours and stay on track with my business goals.
